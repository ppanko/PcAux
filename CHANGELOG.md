# Change Log
All notable changes to the **PcAux** project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog][kacl], and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning][sv].

NOTE: Changes prior to version 0.0.0.9006 were documented retrospectively and 
should, therefore, be viewed with an appropriate degree of skepticism.

## 0.0.0.9015 - 2020-04-15

### Fixed 

- Documentation for `createPcAux` to stay consistent with the new defaults for
  `interactType` and `maxPolyPow`
- Bugs in the unit tests due to the changes to the default values for 
  `interactType` and `maxPolyPow`

### Changed

- forcePmm to off by default inside `createPcAux` in order to give the user 
  control over mice methods
- `createPcAux` now records a `miceObject` after the initial imputation

### Added

- The ability to select imputation methods for `mice` using the `miceMethods` 
  argument in the control list
- New functions `getMiceMethods` to retrieve specified methods for variable
  types and `getMethVec` to retrieve imputation method vector used by mice
- New function `getPredMat` to retrieve the predictor matrix from either 
  `createPcAux` or `miWithPcAux`


## 0.0.0.9014 - 2020-04-09

### Fixed	
- Bug in check on whether `castData` is operating inside `createPcAux`
  causing `doPCA` to crash because unimputed drop variables were erroneously
  added back in
- Typo in helper function `simplePca` referencing `setNComp` instead of 	
  `setNComps`
- Bug resulting from incorrectly subsetting dropVars specified in 
  `miWithPcaux` that were not previously specified
- Bug breaking `interactType = 1` due to the absence of dummy-coded nominal 
  variables
- Bug resulting from having id variables of class `factor` with missing 
  values
- Bug in including/excluding `dropVars` between `createPcAux` and 
  `miWithPcAux`

### Changed

- Defaults for `interactType` and `maxPolyPow` changed to 0 and 1, respecitvely

## 0.0.0.9013 - 2018-09-05

### Fixed
- Bug with calculation of the cumulative proportions of variance explained by 
  the component scores 
- Bug causing inappropriate warnings when not specifying any moderators (Issue 
  #20)
- Bug causing issues when computing interaction terms with certain arrangements 
  of few moderators (Issue #18)
- Bug causing crashes when no ID variables are specified (Issue #21)
- Bug breaking `getLoggedEvents` due to inconsistent object typing by mice
	
### Changed
- Resolved final known issues with the timing utilities contributed by @ppanko
- Exported the `writeStatus` function
- Improved the way interaction terms are computed to be more robust to 
  unanticipated use-cases
- Improved implementation of the `pcAuxW` function
- Cleaned up the source code for the `PcAuxData` class definition

### Added
- A `pcAuxL` function to print licensing information
- Included @Lwaggens (Luke Waggenspack) as a contributor, particularly for help
  with locating and correcting the first bug noted in the above *fixed* 
  subsection
- A `getLoggedEvents` function used to retrieve events produced by `mice`
  during the initial imputation contributed by @ppanko 
  
## 0.0.0.9012 - 2017-11-16

### Fixed
- Changed way interactions are computed to avoid protection stack overflows 
  caused by constructing huge formulae
  
### Changed
- Fix noted in version 0.0.0.9011 partially reverted

    - Polynomials are now constructed from ordinal variables as well as 
	  continuous variables
	- It makes as much sense to construct a polynomial from an ordinal variable 
	  as it does to cast it as numeric and use it in an interaction (which we've 
	  always done)
	- Accordingly, asking for polynomials with only ordinal variables will no 
	  longer trigger an error
	  
- Added linewrapping for startup, error, and warning messages.

## 0.0.0.9011 - 2017-11-14

### Fixed
- Bug causing crashes by trying to construct polynomials with only categorical 
  variables (added an appropriate error message). 
  
## 0.0.0.9010 - 2017-10-24

### Changed
- @IMMAPbjung contributed improvements to the way that predictor matrices are 
  constructed for the initial, single imputation when *P* > *N*.
- @kylelang adjusted the way that the predictor sets for interactions and 
  polynomial terms are defined during the initial, single imputation when *P* > 
  *N*.
  
    - Polynomial terms are imputed using the same predictor set used for the 
	  untransformed version of the variable.
	- Interactions are imputed using the intersection of the predictor sets of
	  the constituent variables.
		
- Updated the maintainer email address.

## 0.0.0.9009 - 2017-09-26

### Added
- @vibhutittu contributed a modified version of *makePredMatrix* that includes
  the option to screen the PcAux variables with *mice::quickpred*

### Fixed
- Bug causing fatal errors when using parallel MI and requesting *compFormat =
  "repeated"* (Issue #14).
  
## 0.0.0.9008 - 2017-09-11

### Fixed
- Bug causing fatal errors when computing polynomial terms in *createPcAux*
- Bug causing fatal errors when merging PcAux in *miWithPcAux* with no
  non-linear component scores

## 0.0.0.9007 - 2017-06-12

### Added
- @ppanko contributed documentation for his timing/benchmarking utilities
- Included tutorial document in the "documentation" directory
- @kylelang removed *writeStatus* from the exports until the bug therewith has
  can be resolved

## 0.0.0.9004 - 2017-03-27

  section and using explicit namespace resolution, where feasible
 
## 0.0.0.9003 - 2017-03-26

### Fixed
- Fixed bug that was causing all PcAux scores to be used as predictors, 
  regardless of what value the user set for the *nComps* argument.

## 0.0.0.9002 - 2017-03-24

### Changed
- Adopted semantic versioning scheme suggested by [Hadley Wickham][hw]

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that occurred while casting nominal variables that was causing 
  missing rows to be excluded from the dummy-coded representations

## 0.0.1 - 2017-03-23

### Changed
- More documentation clean-up after the package name change

## 0.0.0 - 2017-03-23

### Changed
- Changed the name of the package from **quark** to **PcAux**
- Updated README.md
- Cleaned up documentation

## <0.0.0 (i.e., Change history for **quark**) - <2017-03-23

At the same time as changing the name of this package from **quark** to 
**PcAux**, many dramatic changes were made to the package internals and to key 
aspects of the user-interface. For those early-adopters who have become 
familiar with the UI of **quark** please take some time to familiarize yourself 
with the new features of **PcAux**.

The biggest differences that experienced users are likely to notice are in:

1. The ways that the number of PcAux scores are selected (see documentation for 
   `createPcAux` and `miWithPcAux` for details) 
2. The ways that interactions are incorporated into the PcAux scores (the 
   **quark**-era approach is still available by setting `interactType = 3`; see 
   the documentation for `createPcAux` for details)
3. Several places were redundant function arguments were removed (e.g., to 
   exclude polynomial terms you now set `maxPolyPow = 1` without any dedicated 
   logical switch).

Code that ran with **quark** will almost certainly fail with **PcAux**. The 
PcAux development team apologizes for any inconvenience that this lack of 
backward compatibility may cause. 

Please recognize, as this project moves forward, that **PcAux** is a rapidly 
developing piece of beta software, and the development team is, currently, 
making no significant effort to maintain backward compatibility. To do so would 
only stagnate development. Once we release a feature-complete version of 
**PcAux** we will begin to seriously consider backward compatibility.

### Previous Contribution Credits
The original source code for **quark** was adapted from an un-packaged 
implementation written by Dr. Steven Chesnut.

During **quark**-era development:
- @IMMAPbjung (Byungkwan Jung) contributed a routine to check for collinearity 
  using parallel processing
- @vibhutittu (Vibhuti Gupta) contributed an improved algorithm for selecting 
  which variables to exclude when dissolving collinear variable pairs
